# Anomaly detection in credit card data (Python, scikit-learn) 

Author: [Dennis W. Hallema](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennishallema) 

Description: Scikit-learn supervised classification procedure for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in a large dataset. This procedure compares the performance of four classifiers: Logistic Regression, Kernel Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. 

Depends: See `environment.yml`. 

Data: PCA transformed credit card transaction data collected in Europe over the course of two days. This anonymized dataset was created by Worldline and the Machine Learning Group of Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be).

   This creates a new directory "repo" containing the repository files.
2. Install Anaconda and Python  
3. Create a Python environment within the cloned directory using Anaconda: `conda env create`  
   This will download and install the dependencies listed in environment.yml.  
4. Activate the Python environment: `source activate <repo>` (or `conda activate <repo>` on Windows).  
5. Launch the Jupyter Notebook server: `jupyter notebook`  
6. In the opened browser tab, click on a ".ipynb" file to open it.  
7. To run a cell, select it with the mouse and click the "Run" button.  

Troubleshooting: 

* If you need to install dependencies manually run: `conda create -name <repo> dep`  
* If you need to update the Python environment run: `conda env update --file environment.yml`
